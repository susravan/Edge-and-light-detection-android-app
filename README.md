# Edge and Light Detection Android App

This app has been developed as a part of capstone project of "Image and Video Processing" course. In this app, two features have been implemented.
1. Live edge detection - The app takes input feed from camera and converts it to edge detection map in real time
2. Light source detection - The app processed the continuous input feed from camera, detects the light intensity at various parts of the image and detects the light source in the area

Both the features can be toggled with each other by clicking on a radio button on the top of the screen.
